# Description

This site is designed to display relevant information about me and to display a few of the CS projects I've worked on over the years. As a bonus I get to learn more Javascript and tryout some new front-end technologies. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) provided a foundation for this web app, along with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/). Thinking about rewriting without reactstrap though, as it doesn't provide enough flexibility.

# TODO

* Use styled components

* Lint code
* Write up FreeBSD installation guide, publish on Github and link to site
* Interview Prep problems / Data structures examples


# Use

$ npm update //update dependencies
$ push to git for automatic update to netlify? Heroku?
